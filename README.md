# v2.4 AWD
An AWD mod for a Voron v2.4 intially developed for using NEMA14s. ONLY the NEMA14 laser cut parts have been tested on a live printer so far.

NEMA17 dxfs for laser cut parts have been added but not tested. Please report any issues.

Printable versions for both NEMA14 and NEMA17 have been added but not thouroughly tested. There are no printed tensioner plates yet.
